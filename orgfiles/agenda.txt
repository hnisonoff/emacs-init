The success of deep learning at complex tasks has inspired a resurgence
of new machine learning applications in drug discovery. Current
approaches can be generally classified into two categories: 1)
supervised learning techniques that take as input a vector
representation (i.e. fingerprint) of a molecule and output predictions
about molecular properties (e.g. binding affinity to a target protein,
logP...) and 2) unsupervised techniques that employ deep generative
models to propose novel molecules. Generative models operate on the
SMILES text-based representation of molecules, allowing them to exploit
novel techniques from natural language processing (NLP) to reliably
produce valid and diverse molecules. However, vector-based encodings
generally outperform textual encodings in supervised learning tasks,
preventing the ability to generate molecules that are optimized for
complex molecular properties. Here, we present an approach to unify
predictive and generative models by developing artificial neural
networks capable of mapping fingerprints back to the molecule(s) that
produced them. This allows supervised learning models to be "inverted"
to produce novel molecules with desired properties.
